<div>Businessmen who preach that businesses should have a ""social conscience"" are preaching ""pure and unadulterated socialism"". Defending philanthropy as a cornerstone of free enterprise makes you an unwitting puppets controlled by intellectual forces which are undermining free society.</div>
<div>It's difficult to assess how well a leader leads, but indisputable that they contractually agreed to do exactly that.</div>
<div>If an individual believes in giving to organizations, those are the social responsibilities of the person, not their company. If social responsibility is not pure rhetoric, we understand that socially responsible companies must by definition do something against the interests of their shareholders. Committing to socially responsible causes means taking money from employers, employees, or customers - which is against the interests of the company. It's essentially taxation without representation.</div>
<div>Public service nullifies your shareholder obligations &amp; demonstrates your priority is being a public servant. If you're a CEO making this decision, you must have good political machinery in place to manage a large transfer. If you're a shareholder, even more so. This is why union leaders object to government market interference much more than business leaders. Sole proprietors have more freedom &amp; less impact than groups which operate as a collective.</div>
<h2>Social responsibility on a company level harms free society by using justice as an aegis for corporate embezzlement.</h2>
<div>Corporate social responsibility preaches non-collectivist means for collectivist ends.

Even Americans think it’s spelled WEETES</div><div><br></div><div>At GM, workers made $29.50/hr, at Fuyao they make $12.80. Workers are grateful to have jobs at all in Dayton, counting themselves blessed. They make enough to live in relatives’ basements, on relatives’ furniture.</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese workers were surprised at how flat Ohio is. Some have left their families in China to work this job. They are required to be away for two years, with no extra pay. They take a special liking to twinkies, guns, Harleys shown to them by American workers.</div><div><br></div><div>Scald marks on hands/forearms are a super common injury.</div><div><br></div><div>Ohio wants to reject the term “rust belt”, resenting being termed as such by both 2020 presidential candidates.</div><div><br></div><div>Fuyao is very careful to discourage unionization from the outset, even in trainings, and admins joke about killing senator Sherrod Brown who advocated for unionization. They ultimately decide never to let this senator’s team on the premises again. Fuyao boss: “if a Union comes in, I’m shutting down. They keep interfering with my production. I’m bleeding money.” He then coerces other board members to enforce this.</div><div><br></div><div>“The same level of efficiency, cost and quality as our competitors.”</div><div><br></div><div>In response to OSHA singling them out for too-dense factory layouts and too-narrow factory walkways: “a tall tree catches the wind.”</div><div><br></div><div>Honcho: “the most important thing is not how much money we earn, but how this will change the Americans’ views of the Chinese and China.

When we try to manage them, they threaten to get help from the union.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>American execs visit Fuyao’s Chinese plant and are astonished to see flawless synchronous paired work, seamless flow of a part between stations, continuous integration along a conveyor belt. Also they are used to constant supervision and required to report constantly. Additionally, they get only one or two days off per month, and work twelve hour shifts. Many have children they rarely see. One woman returns home to see her young child only once a year, at the Spring Festival. Another has a 6-month and two-year old and says he doesn’t get time to take breaks to see them in some years. Some of them are made to pick through piles of broken glass and sort colors for recyclability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One team’s motto: “To stand still is to move back.”</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese workers are all unionized, but the Union leader is also the secretary to the Fuyao communist party committee, and the brother-in-law to the chairman.</div><div><br></div><div>In a display case they have China’s five leaders since it was established: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zenón, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping. They say the government heavily supports Fuyao, and workers support the company because they are like rowers in a boat: if the boat sinks, everyone loses their jobs.</div><div><br></div><div>They have an insane cross-cultural celebration with extravagant propaganda songs about manufacturing efficiency from a range of kids and teens, plus YMCA dance for American execs, plus a group wedding for employees (complete with wedding ball).</div><div><br></div><div>For the Chinese workers in the Ohio factory, they have televisions on of Chinese children singing and praying all day.</div><div><br></div><div>After American workers protest over 11+ workplace accidents since establishment, Chinese workers are called together for another security briefing about why unionization is disastrous. From January to October the company has lost $40mil. The company fires both its American presidents and hires a new Chinese president, who has spent 27 years in the US and 26 years in China. He cites passion and determination with making him look like he is in his 40s, when in reality he is 53.</div><div><br></div><div>Older American employees adore their Chinese coworkers because most American companies won’t even hire them due to ageism.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than try to find resolution, two employees with differing backgrounds will often try to find blame.</div><div><br></div><div>

<div><b>Cultural sensitivity training 2, later on:</b></div>
<div>“there’s a culture in the US where children are showered with encouragement, so everyone who grows up in the US is overconfident. Americans love being flattered to death. you will get into trouble if you fight with them. Donkeys like being touched in the direction their hair grows. Otherwise they’ll kick you. We need to use our wisdom to guide them and help them, because we are better than them.”</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Two private table discussions occur:</b></div><div>American complaints about the Chinese:</div><div>They’re in the factory practically 24/7 and use this moral superiority to berate Americans during working hours, while offering very little actual help. They refuse to explain orders when asked why. They refuse to show respect. At least 3000 Americans have come and gone by a year in, after being fired or quitting. All American bosses are demoted. China enforced their control culturally and politically. Their workers poured chemicals into sewers and off of docks at the company.</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese complaints about America:</div><div>Chinese workers lament that you can’t force Americans to work overtime, or even announce overtime at a company level, when in China overtime is mandatory. Some argue Saturdays should be required.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One chinese worker says he is impressed Americans can work two jobs, one at the factory and one outside. He says he always thought Americans lived a comfortable and superior life. He thought they didn’t have to make any sacrifices.</div><div><br></div><div><b>At The union meeting:</b></div><div>An American worker’s daughter who does nails for a living made 40k last year (2017), while the Fuyao worker made 27k. Someone’s coworker was fired for taking a week off because they were hospitalized and didn’t report. Work continued around active fires in the factory. Dayton taxpayers pay tens of millions to Fuyao, but Fuyao has not provided for the community.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One speaker: “We rejected 70 years ago that rich people get to pick and choose what happens to you. Nothing in America has changed in terms of working people working hard. That’s not what changed. What changed his people at the top deciding they want to rewrite the rules to take advantage of people. To make it in their favor at your expense. You have a right to say no to that, that’s what you need housing at three hours all about. We found a way to for companies to make money and still pay employees, for employees to be safe.”</div><div><br></div><div>In response, Fuyao hosts a meeting announcing a $2/hr raise for all factory floor emploueees. In exchange, they ask employees “work harder, work longer, to match our factory in China.”</div><div><br></div><div>The American workers succeed in unionizing.
