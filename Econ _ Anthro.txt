"CCsk#UP@t#"	Basic	Econ / Anthro	The Friedman Doctrine	"<div>Milton Friedman, 1970</div><div>A business's chief social responsibility is to increase its profits, because the social responsibility of the business to its customers is to increase its profits.</div>
<div>Businessmen who preach that businesses should have a ""social conscience"" are preaching ""pure and unadulterated socialism"". Defending philanthropy as a cornerstone of free enterprise makes you an unwitting puppets controlled by intellectual forces which are undermining free society.</div>
<div>It's difficult to assess how well a leader leads, but indisputable that they contractually agreed to do exactly that.</div>
<div>If an individual believes in giving to organizations, those are the social responsibilities of the person, not their company. If social responsibility is not pure rhetoric, we understand that socially responsible companies must by definition do something against the interests of their shareholders. Committing to socially responsible causes means taking money from employers, employees, or customers - which is against the interests of the company. It's essentially taxation without representation.</div>
<div>Public service nullifies your shareholder obligations &amp; demonstrates your priority is being a public servant. If you're a CEO making this decision, you must have good political machinery in place to manage a large transfer. If you're a shareholder, even more so. This is why union leaders object to government market interference much more than business leaders. Sole proprietors have more freedom &amp; less impact than groups which operate as a collective.</div>
<h2>Social responsibility on a company level harms free society by using justice as an aegis for corporate embezzlement.</h2>
<div>Corporate social responsibility preaches non-collectivist means for collectivist ends. However, the most collectivist a company can be is simply to engage in free and open competition without coercion, fraud, or deception, and to attempt to secure the benefits of cooperative business.</div>"	economics history sociology
