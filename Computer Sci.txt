Why Countries hack each other	● Financial gain 💰<br>○ IP, economic development, theft (e.g. DPRK, PRC)<br>● Information collection (espionage) 🕵<br>○ PRC’s &amp; RU’s hacks to get coronavirus research<br>● Covert action (influence ops, sabotage) 🐀<br>● Armed conflict 💥<br>● “Prepare the battlefield” 🧨<br>○ Gain access to system now so you can act later <br>○ NSA access in DPRK → Sony hack attribution<br>● “Hold at risk” (deterrence) 🦈<br>○ Let your hack be detected, so your target knows <br>you could damage their assets <br>○ U.S. didn’t hide incursions into RU power grid<br>3	
What are response options after another country hacks yours?	● Pretend it didn’t happen 🙈<br>● Make some angry noises but do nothing 🤷<br>● Indict individual state-affiliated hackers ⚖<br>○ DPRK (APT-38), PRC (APT-40), RU (Sandworm)<br>● Restrict exports to foreign entities involved <br>in the hack 📦🚫<br>○ US firms can’t do business with foreign firms<br>○ Harder for foreign firms to attract investment<br>● Sanctions, e.g. Biden 2021 Russia sanctions ✂ <br>○ Economic sanctions: impede economic growth<br>○ Diplomatic sanctions<br>■ Kick out individual diplomats<br>■ Close an entire embassy or consulate <br>● Cyber counterstrike  💻<br>● FIRE ZE MISSILES (“kinetic response”) 💥	
Computer Network Operations: CND, CNE, CNA	● Computer Network Defense (CND)<br>○ Actions taken via computer networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, &amp; <br>respond to network attacks, intrusions, disruptions or other unauthorized <br>actions that would compromise or cripple the defender’s information systems &amp; <br>networks.<br>● Computer Network Exploitation (CNE)<br>○ Enabling actions &amp; intelligence collection via computer networks that exploit <br>data gathered from the target’s information systems or networks.<br>● Computer Network Attack (CNA)<br>○ Actions taken via computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the <br>information within computers and computer networks and/or the <br>computers/networks themselves.<br><br>Tarah Wheeler on SolarWinds: “cyberwarfare” (CNA) vs. “cyberespionage” (CNE)<br>Cyberwarfare is the use of computers to conduct an operation that is intended to have a kinetic effect, whether that is shutting down power grids, crashing airplanes, <br>denying access to critical communications, attacking military infrastructure, or <br>interrupting hospital operations. ...<br>Cyberespionage, on the other hand, is the act of a government listening in on the <br>activities of foreign computers. ... SolarWinds did not do one dollar of physical <br>damage to any computer system, nor did a single human so much as break a finger-<br>nail, and, as a result, this operation was an act of cyberespionage.<br>Source<br>CNA	
Threat Reduction Strategies	"<img src=""Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 2.18.10 PM.png"">"	
CISA: domestic non-military cyber defense	● Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency <br>● Part of DHS - main agency in charge of civilian cybersecurity since 2018<br>● In charge of physical- &amp; cyber-security of federal networks &amp; critical infra<br>○ Protects civilian federal agencies (.gov)<br>■ E.g., ordering federal agencies to fix known, actively-exploited vulns in their systems<br>○ Helps private-sector “critical infrastructure” entities (.com) increase their security<br>■ C.I. = 16 sectors, such as communications, energy, banking, emergency services, etc.<br>■ Conducts vuln assessments, provides tools &amp; training, provides info on emerging threats <br>■ Subpoena power to warn C.I. system owners of vulnerabilities, via their ISPs<br>● Subpoenas ISP to find out who the system owner is; notifies the owner; owner fixes vuln	
Cyberspace Solarium Commission report (March 2020)	● Comprehensive strategic approach to defending U.S. in cyberspace<br>● Vision: “layered cyber deterrence” to limit use of cyberspace against U.S.<br>○ Shape behavior: Promote responsible behavior in cyberspace &amp; isolate bad actors <br>○ Deny benefits: Public/private collab to secure critical networks &amp; build resilience<br>○ Impose costs: Build capacity to “defend forward” &amp; retain U.S. offensive capabilities<br>● Goal: Change attacker cost-benefit calculus → reduce attack frequency &amp; severity<br>○ Through public/private collab, raise adversary costs in using cyberspace offensively<br>○ Attacks will still happen but eventually won’t be major threats to economy/society	
Domestic law relevant to cyber conflict	● Courts: smaller role than other branches<br>○ Criminal: Rise in DOJ indictments of foreign gov-affiliated hackers<br>■ Mostly in absentia, so questionable if any deterrent effect<br>■ Examples: Sandworm (RU), APT-40 (PRC), APT-38 (DPRK).<br>○ Civil: Foreign govts can’t be sued in U.S. courts for hacking U.S. targets<br>■ Foreign governments are generally immune from civil lawsuits<br>● NSO Group tried to dodge WhatsApp lawsuit this way 🙄<br>■ Exception for torts (wrongful conduct) doesn’t apply<br>● Courts say tort must occur wholly in U.S. → hacks from abroad don’t qualify <br>and so foreign govt hackers can’t be sued civilly in U.S. courts<br><br>● Congress: <br>○ Powers: declare war, regulate &amp; terminate uses of force, power of the purse<br>○ U.S. Code Title 10, ch. 19: Statutory authorities for military cyber ops <br>■ SecDef may conduct military cyber activities or ops in cyberspace, including <br>clandestine ones<br>■ Requires appropriate authorization; subject to oversight by Congress<br>■ Purposes: “preparation of the environment, information operations, force <br>protection, and deterrence of hostilities, or counterterrorism operations...”<br><br>● Executive: very active in recent years in this area<br>○ NSPM-13 (2018) (classified) <br>■ Presidential directive that loosened rules for cyber operations<br>■ Military can use hacking tools w/less oversight from other agencies<br>■ Revisions by Biden admin underway<br>● DOD will reportedly retain some key broad authorities<br>● DOD will have to give WH details well in advance<br>● Dispute process for agencies e.g. State to flag ops they find concerning<br>○ EO 14024 (April 2021): Sanctions on Russia<br>■ Response to SolarWinds hack, 2020 election interference, etc.<br>■ Unsurprisingly, Russian gov-affiliated hackers are still hacking<br><br>● 2018 Presidential Finding <br>○ Like NSPM-13: easier for CIA to authorize its own ops w/o WH approval<br>○ Changes:<br>■ Easier for CIA to damage adversaries’ critical infra (e.g. cut off electricity)<br>■ Easier for CIA to carry out “hack and dump” ops<br>■ Previously off-limits targets (e.g. banks) are now in-bounds<br>■ Lower bar to carry out ops against non-gov entities (e.g. media orgs, charities, <br>religious groups) believed to be foreign intel operatives<br>○ Has been used for over a dozen cyber ops vs. PRC, RU, Iran, DPRK<br>■ Both “stuff is on fire and exploding” &amp; “hack and dump”	
United Nations UN Charter 1945	● Art. 2(4): Don’t hit each other...<br> “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of <br>force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any <br>other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” <br>● Art. 51: ...but if someone hits you first, you may hit back<br>“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or <br>collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United <br>Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain <br>international peace and security. ...”<br>* (Or with authorization by UN Security Council or the consent of the other state)	
International Humanitarian Law:&nbsp;<i>jus in bello&nbsp;</i>(Rules of War)	● Limits on acceptable conduct while already engaged in war (Geneva Convention)<br>● Distinction: Who are legitimate targets?<br>○ Avoid harm to civilian noncombatants<br>● Proportionality: How much force is appropriate? <br>○ Oppose force with similar force; use minimum force needed to thwart attacker<br>○ Injury caused should be proportional to the desired objective<br>○ Costs shouldn’t outweigh benefits<br>● Distinction &amp; proportionality challenges in cyber realm <br>○ E.g., Stuxnet designed to minimize collateral damage... but still spread beyond target<br>○ MSFT: RU has taken more care than with NotPetya to confine CNA to Ukr domains<br><br><br><br><b>Jus ad bellum (right to war)<br></b>● When may a state engage in use of force to defend itself?<br>● Characterization of cyber op determines permissible response<br>○ “Soft” cyber op (use info to influence, persuade, manipulate): kinetic response not OK<br>○ “Hard” cyber op (effect on data C/I/A, and/or physical effect): harder line to draw<br>■ States disagree over whether cyber ops with no physical effect = “use of force”<br>● Not every cyber op is a “use of force”; not every use of force is an “armed attack”<br>● When does a hostile cyber operation rise to the level of an “armed attack”? <br>○ No consensus; many states say only the gravest “uses of force” = “armed attacks”<br>○ Pentagon disagrees: all unlawful uses of force = armed attacks; so if an unlawful <br>cyber op = use of force → justifies use of force (cyber or kinetic) in response

Steve Jobs Mockumentary	"-Change in product price points $1500-$2495 had made them less competitive ahead of their first launch of the Macintosh<br>-Replaced the motorola 6809 with the 68000, which supported menus, windows, point-and-click, high-res graphics<br>-at the time, memory was what cost the most money<br>-Steve &amp; Chrisann's relationship was an enormous mess; he manipulated her into a victim complex for having needs and a child to raise alone<br>-He had a preposterous god complex which he used to erase his bad deeds<br>-His delusion was deepened by half a billion of wealth<br>-Wozniak was a huge advocate for the computers too have more e.g. 8 slots, while Steve argued for two slots exactly - a printer and a modem<br>-2 minutes ahead of showtime they decided to commit fraud by demoing a 128 computer on a 512, which was shipping in under a year. The decision was made because Jobs felt that computers had been made too scary by Hollywood and needed the ability to speak in order to be huumanized.
